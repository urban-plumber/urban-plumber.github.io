**NOTE:** *Results presented here are highly dependent on how models are configured in this experiment and may be subject to variable output formatting errors. Results are not intended to indicate the quality of any individual model, but to help participants better understand and improve modelling approaches in different urban environments.*


# UK-KingsCollege results

 - [Participant metadata and submitted variables](../index.md)
 - [Baseline results](../baseline/index.md)
 - [Detailed results](../detailed/index.md)

## Mean absolute error (MAE)

**A single error metric cannot characterise the performance of a model. For analysis refer to the associated paper.**

Order is based on the urban model classifications provided, nominally from simpler to more complex.
