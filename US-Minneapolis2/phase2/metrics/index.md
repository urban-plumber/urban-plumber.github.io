Results are not intended to indicate the quality of any individual model, but to help participants better understand and improve modelling approaches in different urban environments.*

## Mean absolute error (MAE)

**A single error metric cannot characterise the performance of a model. For analysis refer to the associated paper.**

Order is based on the urban model classifications provided, nominally from simpler to more complex.
